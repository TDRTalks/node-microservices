# Building Real World Node.JS Microservices

“Microservces are small services with independent lifecycles that work together” -Sam Newman. In this talk I'll be presenting some core principles I think represent what makes microservices work well using Node.JS and Docker. After a brief introduction of what microservices are and why they are important, we'll spend the bulk of the time looking at how BDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing coupled with modern CI/CD techniques can help you deploy containers to a Docker swarm in any cloud. We’ll explore best practices, code, and tooling to get the job done right. I'd say that beginners will get a sense of what microservices are and what makes different, whereas more experienced practitioners will get an insight into practical advice into how to implement them.
